# Clean Water Machine Learning Competition @CentraleSupelec

## General context 

This project is part of a competition at University Paris Saclay, CentraleSupelec Paris. 

Files and descriptions are in French. For general purposes, this readme is the only content in english inside this project so that everyone can understand the context. 

## The Competition 

Access to safe drinking water is essential to health, a basic human right, and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional, and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.

The dataset is available at this link [drinking_water_potability.csv](https://github.com/bidouze/CleanWaterData/blob/main/drinking_water_potability.csv). The file file contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies. The easiest way to run the following notebooks using this dataset is to unzip the csv file in the root folder of the repo.
